            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro">Working hard, being honest, being passionate about learning new things, team player and a leader are some of the qualities that define me. In my career, I have always been defined by my dedication to completing tasks on time and to the best of my abilities. As a professional, I have worked on exciting new technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, DevOps, linux, ELK, Debezium, Kafka. In my career I have focused on system design. By applying auto-scaling, I improved the performance of the application when a large load is present on the system, as well as saving money. To fine tune G1GC according to our application, I also worked on its configuration. In addition, I established the connection between ELK and DB using Debezium Kafka.</p>
